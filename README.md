# Street-Fighter
This is a game consisting of Javascript, CSS and HTML. It contains button functionality and a scoring system that determines a winner and a loser. Buttons Q and P will be used to attack the points of the opponent.

In summary,
this project helped me develop a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, which are essential skills for any computer scientist or software engineer. They also provided practical experience in designing and implementing algorithms and data structures and in analyzing their performance.

I reflected on my approach to solving problems related to data structures and algorithms in this project for this course. I evaluated the importance of understanding data structures, their approach to overcoming roadblocks, and how this project impacted my software design and programming practices.

I encountered two roadblocks while working on this project. Firstly, understanding the implementation details of different data structures. This was resolved by reviewing class notes and watching tutorials. Secondly, implementing the sorting algorithm correctly. This was resolved by breaking down the problem into smaller parts, testing each part separately, and then integrating them into a working solution.

This project expanded the way I approach software design and development, emphasizing the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms, considering trade-offs, testing, optimization, and documentation.

This project has improved my programming skills and approach by emphasizing modular design, clear code, and error handling.
